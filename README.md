# Muon Tomography - Abhijit Bhattacharyya
 There are two types of codes. The frontend is JAVAFX
 based code which configures the setup of the hodoscope
 and then triggers the running of the C++ based simulation 
 code for the tomography.
#
 The result is displayed in the front-end again.
#
#
 The code is under development
#
Go to CC/build
Run ./doClean to clean un-wanted codes
Run cmake ../
Run make
Run ./doRun to run the code.
